      "description": "This course introduces students to three perspectives that are fundamental to their ability to reason with data: critical thinking, inferential thinking, and computational thinking. Through data modeling and visualization, students will construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism, entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they gain in this class to enhance those interests. Not to mention a grounding for students who want to pursue the field of data science itself. Effective Fall 2021, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Social Inquiry 1, Digital/Multimedia Expression, Research and Information Literacy.",

Important decisions impacting criminal justice, housing, finance, labor, healthcare, and education are frequently determined by or are aided by artificially intelligent algorithmic technologies that are built and trained on large datasets. The rise in these technologies presents a challenge for social justice. Though often presented as neutral decision aids, these technologies often produce harmful predictions that operate to reinforce old legacies of racial, class, gender, and heteropatriarchal subordination. Datafication practices, computational techniques, legal doctrine, and policy play a key role in facilitating these disparate outcomes. This course will center on the complicated relationship between social justice and data science. The course will introduce students to the historical and current role of datafication and computation practices in social subordination.

      "description": "This course offers students in computing disciplines the opportunity to apply their programming and system development skills by working on real-world projects provided from partnering organizations within and outside of BU, which are curated by Spark! The course offers a range of project options where students can improve their technical skills, while also gaining the soft skills necessary to deliver projects aligned to the partner's goals. These include teamwork and communications skills and software development processes. All students participating in the course are expected to complete a software engineering project including a final presentation to the partner organization.

      "short_title": "Biological Data Sci Reading",
      "description": "The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework, skills, and knowledge to critically evaluate research in biological data science. Biological research is rarely unequivocal in its findings; students will learn to systematically identify the claims advanced in research papers and evaluate whether each claim is established beyond a reasonable doubt by supporting evidence. We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine the computational approach. Students will work with published data and computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a critical review of a broader topic in the field. Prereq: Experience with computational biology.",
